Quickemu Mod - Virtual Machine Launcher  -  A menu interfaced version of quickemu .....

In response to https://github.com/quickemu-project/quickemu/issues/572  Windows 10 VM won't launch after upgrade from 4.3 to 4.4

&  https://github.com/quickemu-project/quickemu/issues/553  2022-08 Security Update for Windows fails to install

I started looking at the Martin's quickemu script, in depth  :rofl:

Use this script along-side original quickemu or as a backwardly compatible drop-in replacement.

Currently in beta 1.   QuickGet-Mod to follow shortly, depending on how this fork works out.  

Lots of new added fixes & features. Very configurable. See the settings file.


Install original quickemu as normal.  Download the qmod zip to your VMs folder ...  Read notes in settings file for full details.

Make sure you have given the scripts "allow executing" +x permissions.

And that your file manager is set 'ask each time' in the behaviour section.  Some desktops will be slightly different ...
