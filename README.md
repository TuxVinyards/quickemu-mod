Use along-side original quickemu or as a drop-in replacement.  


## Install

Download the qmod zip to your VMs folder.  

The simplest method is just to place files quickemu-mod & qmod_settings next to your VM .conf files.

Make sure you have given the scripts "allow executing" +x permissions.  Click and go. üëç

The initial set up should be with the original quickemu as normal.  https://github.com/quickemu-project/quickemu

Read the main file & settings file for further details on location tweaks and other features.

Your file manager may need setting to 'ask each time' in the behaviour section.  Some desktops will be slightly different ...

## Issues & Pull Requests

In response to https://github.com/quickemu-project/quickemu/issues/572  Windows 10 VM won't launch after upgrade from 4.3 to 4.4 &  https://github.com/quickemu-project/quickemu/issues/553  2022-08 Security Update for Windows fails to install I started looking at the Martin's quickemu script, in depth  :rofl:

Currently in beta 1.  Hopefully there won't be too many issues. I want to get on with finishing the modded version of QuickGet ...

I have included a (Visual Studio) Code workspace file to help anyone doing editing. The global shellcheck supression will help with all the 'args' warnings that come from the original quickemu code  (may adapt for other editors too).

Please make any pull requests annotated. Everyone codes differently, I know, but I think readabilty & KISS (keep it simple & straightforward) is key. Explain how the code works so everyone can follow what's going on.

No densely packed lines of unexplained regex style hieroglyphics, please, to put it another way. üòÉ
